# Token Replacer

Formatter to replace tokens in filenames and in NFOs. The formatter works differently based on the type of strings it's formatting. [Flat](flat.md) and [multi-line](multi-line.md) strings are formatted and support different features. NfoForge utilizes TokenReplacer to fill [tokens](tokens.md) during formatting.
