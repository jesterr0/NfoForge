# NfoForge

A powerful media upload assistant.

## Information

NfoForge is currently under active development, and Iâ€™m excited to share it with the community now that it has reached a stable stage.

At present, **Movies** are the only supported media type. However, support for **TV shows** and **Anime** is already planned and will be added in the near future.

Comprehensive documentation is on the way and will be available soon.

## Key Features

- Token system for advanced media file renaming.
- Integration with TMDB and IMDb for title parsing.
- Flexible Jinja-based template system for .NFO file generation.
- Screenshot generation and upload, including comparisons.
- Output file organization, saving .torrent and .NFO files to disk.
- Torrent cloning support for multi-tracker releases without re-generation.
- Duplicate release checker - checks trackers for duplicates pre-upload.
- Integration with Deluge, qBittorrent, Transmission, rTorrent, and watch folders, as well as fast resume support.
- Plugin support for Python (.py) and compiled (.pyd) files (.pyd compiled files require the same Python version as NfoForge).
- Support for movie files in MKV and MP4 format.
- Automatic detection for light/dark mode (with a manual override if desired).
- Additional format support and features coming soon!
