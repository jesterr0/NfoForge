```

### Daily Episode Format  
```
{series_title_clean} - {air_date} - {episode_title_clean} [{resolution} {source} {video_codec} {audio_codec}]-{release_group}
```

### Anime Episode Format
```
{series_title_clean} - S{season:02d}E{episode:02d} - {absolute_episode:03d} - {episode_title_clean} [{resolution} {source} {video_codec} {audio_codec}]-{release_group}
```

### Season Folder Format
```
Season {season}
```

## Benefits Achieved
1. **Sonarr-like Interface**: Familiar UI for users coming from Sonarr
2. **Flexible Episode Formats**: Support for different TV show types
3. **Multi-Episode Support**: Configurable handling of multi-episode files
4. **Real-time Previews**: Live updates when global settings change
5. **Consistent Architecture**: Follows same patterns as movies management
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Tracker overrides still use existing MVR system

## Integration Status
‚úÖ **Complete**: Series management page with all episode format types
‚úÖ **Tested**: All files compile successfully without syntax errors  
‚úÖ **Connected**: Global management integration for live updates
‚úÖ **Configured**: Default settings and config loading/saving
‚úÖ **UI Ready**: Full Sonarr-inspired interface with multiple format types

## Future Enhancements
The series management system is ready for use! The tracker override system currently uses the existing MVR structure for compatibility. Future improvements could include:

1. Create series-specific tracker overrides (TVR-based)
2. Add series-specific tokens for episode numbering, air dates, etc.
3. Implement series-specific example data for better previews
4. Add validation for episode format tokens

The foundation is now in place for a comprehensive TV series management system that matches the flexibility and features of popular tools like Sonarr! üéâ

## Implementation Priority

### Recommended Order:
1. **Phase 1** - Core Infrastructure (enables basic functionality)
2. **Phase 3** - Token System (unlocks most features)
3. **Phase 2** - Configuration (makes settings persistent)
4. **Phase 4** - Backend Processing (enhances functionality)
5. **Phase 5** - Tracker Integration (completes upload workflow)
6. **Phase 6** - UI/UX Polish (improves user experience)

## Key Architecture Guidelines

### Consistency Patterns
- Follow existing movie implementation patterns
- Use `svr_*` prefix for series configs (parallel to `mvr_*` for movies)
- Maintain backward compatibility with movie workflows
- Reuse common logic where possible (media processing, image generation, uploads)

### Code Organization
- Create separate token classes/groups for movies vs series
- Use media mode switches rather than duplicating code
- Implement proper error handling for series-specific edge cases
- Document series-specific configuration options

### Testing Considerations
- Test with various series naming patterns
- Validate episode vs season vs complete series detection
- Ensure tracker uploads work correctly
- Test media mode switching doesn't break existing functionality

## Progress Tracking

Use the checkboxes above to track implementation progress. Update this document as tasks are completed or requirements change.

## Additional Notes

- Consider anime-specific handling (seasons, OVAs, specials)
- Think about miniseries vs full series distinctions
- Plan for different episode numbering schemes (absolute vs seasonal)
- Consider multi-part episodes and special episodes
